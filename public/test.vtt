00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:03.293
(airplane jet engine)

2
00:00:03.293 --> 00:00:06.376
(bright music plays)

3
00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:11.223
- Really just stumbled on them through a website

4
00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:13.501
where they post medical transcription jobs

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.141
This other company was out there,

6
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:18.389
saying, "Hey. We're looking for transcriptionists."

7
00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:19.722
I clicked on it.

8
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.420
Moved very quickly.

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.270
Within less than a week, I was already working.

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.839
- Rev is first and foremost a translation

11
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.839
and transcription agency

12
00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:32.409
and flexibility is extremely important to me as a student.

13
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.151
We can claim jobs as we like,

14
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.030
or we can not claim jobs if we don't have time to do them.

15
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.197
- I'm getting paid to transcribe these

16
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.899
and I'm learning things.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.583
I've typed sermons, some great inspiring sermons.

18
00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:52.117
I'm getting to do all this fun stuff and I'm learning

19
00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.279
and that is just a tremendous experience.

20
00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:56.178
- I like the challenge of a word

21
00:00:56.178 --> 00:00:59.216
and the most challenging part of my job

22
00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:01.635
is when I am transcribing something

23
00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:04.217
and they use a word that I don't know.

24
00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:06.971
I look it up and I want to make sure I know what it is,

25
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.370
that it fits the context of the sentence.

26
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.270
Then I try to - I do this with my kids.

27
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.603
I try to use it.

28
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.541
- I feel like I've gotten to know Rev as a company

29
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:18.639
and the executives, even, at Rev

30
00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.949
and it's nice to have that more personal connection,

31
00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:23.150
even though it's such a big company.

32
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.983
- You know what?

33
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:24.816
They're real people.

34
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:26.647
They're real people and I like that.

35
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:28.663
They're real people and they treat you like a real person.

36
00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:29.927
- I really was shocked.

37
00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:31.306
I called my husband and said,

38
00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:32.377
"Hey, not only did I get a job,

39
00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:33.567
"but I've already earned money today.

40
00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.060
"What do you think of that?"

41
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.293
You're always leery about anything that says,

42
00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:39.126
"Work from home."

43
00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:41.881
It's got a negative connotation to it

44
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.184
and everybody thinks it's a scam,

45
00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:45.019
but Rev is not.

46
00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.852
It's not a scam.

47
00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:47.378
I truly get paid every week,

48
00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.378
which is also fantastic.

49
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.748
- I did recently purchase a house in Urbana

50
00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.870
and that was a big commitment,

51
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.037
a large part of which was financed by my work with Rev.

52
00:01:59.047 --> 00:02:02.993
It's been great, not only in the here and the now

53
00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:03.976
for the income,

54
00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:06.775
but also as a professional development thing.

55
00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:09.286
It's invaluable, as far as what it's going to do

56
00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:11.737
for my job security and my options

57
00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:14.814
when I get out of school and start looking for

58
00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:15.992
full time work.

59
00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:19.552
- I don't miss school appointments or school plays

60
00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.821
or that kind of thing.

61
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.200
We don't miss soccer practice, we don't miss soccer games.

62
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.923
Those are benefits that you can't get in an office.

63
00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:28.612
- I get to work for a living,

64
00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:31.517
earn some money, work for a company I like,

65
00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.830
and pursue my passion, which is writing.

66
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.468
I'm not sure how it can get much better than that.

67
00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:40.551
